To Whom It May Concern:

Even though KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_47 has only been public for less than 72 hours, I decided to finalize that chapter of karbytes (and the larger encompassing karbytes version named karbytes2025_20) as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 07_AUGUST_2025. That is because I want to stop the growth of what I consider to be "low quality" (i.e. unprofessional-sounding, overly personal, or superfluous) content in current and future chapters of karbytes. 

(I hope and expect that all future chapters of karbytes will consist only of "high quality" content or at least not contain any "low quality" content (even if that means that there are no future chapters of karbytes)).

I noticed some "low quality" content has seeped into this chapter (but most of this chapter is what I consider to be sufficiently "high quality" and I like the fact that this chapter is relatively compact and error-free (which means that this chapter can be used as somewhat of a template for the next chapter (excluding the "low quality" or current-chapter-only content))).

To show what I mean, I have decided to generate a list of files which I intend to include in the next chapter (with some file name details including generic placeholder text instead of more specific text such as calendar dates). That file is located in this chapter at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_47/main/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_48.html

Sincerely,
karbytes
