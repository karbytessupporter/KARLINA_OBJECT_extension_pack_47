karbytes:

I'm saving up money to get my whole genome sequenced with Dante Labs and was wondering if the resulting FASTA format file I would be downloading could be uploaded to GitHub (given that it is a much larger file than 25 megabytes).

ChatGPT:

Good question ‚Äî you‚Äôre right to consider file size and GitHub‚Äôs limits before planning to upload your whole genome FASTA.

Here are the key points:

1. File size expectations

A human whole genome in FASTA format (just the raw sequence, no quality scores) is usually around 3‚Äì4 GB.

If you also get a FASTQ file (with quality scores), that can easily exceed 100 GB.

A compressed FASTA (like .fa.gz) might shrink to ~800 MB ‚Äì 1 GB, but still well above 25 MB.

2. GitHub file size limits

Individual file upload limit: 100 MB (hard limit on the web interface).

GitHub encourages keeping repos under 1 GB total.

For larger files (up to 2 GB each), you need to use Git Large File Storage (Git LFS).

Git LFS works, but it comes with bandwidth quotas: free plan allows 1 GB storage & 1 GB bandwidth per month (you‚Äôd need to pay for more if people actually download the file often).

3. Practical options

Git LFS: Viable if you want your genome on GitHub and are okay with potentially paying for extra storage/bandwidth.

External hosting + GitHub link: Store the FASTA file in a large file service (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, Internet Archive, Zenodo, or even your own server) and link from your GitHub repo. This avoids GitHub‚Äôs LFS costs.

Chunking: Split the FASTA into multiple parts under 100 MB each and upload separately, though this is clunky.

4. Privacy consideration

Keep in mind: uploading your genome publicly is effectively irreversible. Anyone could download it, and it contains identifying information. If you want it public, GitHub is technically fine (with Git LFS), but you may also want a repository that‚Äôs deliberately oriented toward data hosting (like Zenodo, Dryad, or the Internet Archive).

‚úÖ So, short answer:

Yes ‚Äî you could upload your FASTA to GitHub, but only if you use Git LFS. Otherwise, the file size is too big. If you‚Äôd like to avoid GitHub LFS quotas, I‚Äôd recommend hosting the file externally and just linking to it from your repo.

Do you want me to show you how to set up Git LFS for a large file like your genome FASTA (so you could still keep it in your GitHub repo), or would you prefer I show you the external hosting route?

karbytes:

What is Git LFS?

ChatGPT:

Great question üëç ‚Äî Git LFS (short for Git Large File Storage) is an extension to Git that allows you to version and store files that are too large for normal Git tracking, such as big datasets, videos, audio files, or (in your case) genome FASTA files.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

üîπ Why Git LFS Exists

Standard Git stores the entire history of every file in your repo.

That‚Äôs fine for text/code, but with big files (like a 3 GB FASTA), Git would:

Quickly blow up repo size.

Make clones and pulls painfully slow.

Often exceed GitHub‚Äôs 100 MB per-file limit.

Git LFS solves this by storing only a small pointer file in the repo, while the actual big file lives in a special LFS storage server.

üîπ How Git LFS Works

You install Git LFS on your machine.

You tell Git LFS which file types to track (e.g. *.fasta).

When you add & commit those files, Git saves only a pointer file in your repo.

The actual big file is uploaded to GitHub‚Äôs LFS servers.

When someone clones your repo, Git LFS downloads the real files separately.

üîπ GitHub LFS Limits

Free Plan:

1 GB of LFS storage

1 GB of LFS bandwidth per month

Paid plans allow more (you can buy extra storage/bandwidth in 50 GB packs).

Without LFS, you can‚Äôt push files bigger than 100 MB to GitHub at all.

üîπ Basic Example

[bash]

# Install Git LFS (one-time)
git lfs install

# Tell Git LFS to track FASTA files
git lfs track "*.fasta"

# Add the .gitattributes file Git LFS created
git add .gitattributes

# Add your genome file
git add genome.fasta

# Commit
git commit -m "Add whole genome FASTA via Git LFS"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

[end bash]

Now your repo will contain a tiny pointer file for genome.fasta, while the real FASTA is on GitHub‚Äôs LFS server.

üîπ Analogy

Think of Git LFS like a coat check:

Git repo: keeps the claim ticket (pointer).

LFS storage: holds the actual heavy coat (your genome).

When you (or others) need the coat, Git LFS fetches it using the claim ticket.

‚ö° Question for you:

Do you plan for your genome FASTA to be publicly downloadable from GitHub, or mostly just stored there for your own archival purposes? That will help me suggest whether Git LFS is the right path or if external hosting might suit you better.

karbytes:

I am trying to make my genome FASTA publicly downloadable (and also saveable to the WayBack Machine). Would I be able to do that if I break the FASTA file into chunks and then upload those chunk files?

ChatGPT:

Yes ‚Äî breaking your genome FASTA into chunks is a workable strategy for publishing it on GitHub without Git LFS, though there are some trade‚Äëoffs to consider.

üîπ How Chunking Could Work

Split your FASTA into multiple files, each <100 MB (the GitHub per‚Äëfile hard limit).

Upload those files into your repo (GitHub web interface or Git).

Provide a script or instructions for how to recombine the chunks back into the original FASTA.

Example: Splitting

[bash]

# Split into 95 MB chunks
split -b 95M genome.fasta genome_part_

[end bash]

This produces files like:

[preformatted_text]

genome_part_aa
genome_part_ab
genome_part_ac
...

[end preformatted_text]

Example: Rejoining

[bash]

cat genome_part_* > genome.fasta

[end bash]

That restores the original FASTA.

üîπ Pros

‚úÖ No need for Git LFS (so no bandwidth/storage quotas).

‚úÖ Keeps everything in one GitHub repo (and thus archiveable via the WayBack Machine).

‚úÖ Works with GitHub‚Äôs 100 MB hard limit.

‚úÖ WayBack Machine would capture each chunk file separately.

üîπ Cons

‚ùå Inconvenient for users (they must download multiple files and reassemble).

‚ùå More cluttered repo (dozens of parts for a 3‚Äì4 GB file).

‚ùå Less efficient for archival: the WayBack Machine may need to crawl many separate URLs.

‚ùå Some risk of human error when recombining.

üîπ Alternative for Easier Access

If your goal is public download + WayBack Machine archiving, you might get better results by:

Hosting the full FASTA on Internet Archive (which allows multi‚ÄëGB files with no quota).

Linking that file from your GitHub repo.

The WayBack Machine will capture both the GitHub page and the external download link.

This way, your GitHub repo holds the ‚Äúpointer‚Äù (and possibly a small sample or README), while the full genome lives in a more data‚Äëfriendly host.

‚úÖ Answer: Yes, you can split your FASTA into <100 MB chunks and upload them to GitHub, then provide a recombination method. It will work, and the WayBack Machine will archive each chunk. But for a smoother experience, hosting the full FASTA on a big‚Äëfile‚Äëfriendly service (like Internet Archive) and linking from GitHub might be cleaner.

Do you want me to draft a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep plan for doing the chunked GitHub upload method so you can maximize WayBack Machine archival, or would you prefer I outline the Internet Archive route (which might be more user‚Äëfriendly)?

karbytes:

Are there upload or storage size limits for files being stored on Google Drive?

ChatGPT:

Yes ‚Äî Google Drive does have file upload and storage limits, but they‚Äôre much more generous than GitHub. Here‚Äôs a breakdown (as of 2025):

üîπ Google Drive Upload & Storage Limits

Per‚ÄëFile Size Limit

You can upload files up to 5 TB each, provided your account has enough available storage space.

So your whole genome FASTA (3‚Äì4 GB) is well within the limit.

Even a full FASTQ (100+ GB) fits comfortably, if you have storage space.

Total Storage Space

Depends on your plan:

Free Google account: 15 GB total shared across Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos.

Google One paid plans:

100 GB, 200 GB, 2 TB, and higher tiers (up to 30 TB).

Daily Upload Limits

Up to 750 GB per day across all files.

Files larger than 750 GB can still be uploaded, but the remainder of that file will finish uploading (you just can‚Äôt start new uploads that day).

File Types

Virtually any type is allowed, including .fasta, .fastq, .vcf, etc.

üîπ Public Access / Sharing

You can set a file‚Äôs permissions to ‚ÄúAnyone with the link can view‚Äù for public access.

However, Google Drive links sometimes expire or get flagged if the file is heavily downloaded.

The WayBack Machine can capture the link page but often can‚Äôt archive the actual file contents, since Google Drive requires a special request for the file download.

üîπ Practical Implication for Your Genome FASTA

Google Drive easily supports a 3‚Äì4 GB FASTA file.

But: if you want archival permanence (especially with the WayBack Machine), Drive isn‚Äôt ideal. The WayBack Machine usually won‚Äôt archive the actual genome file ‚Äî just the Drive download page.

For permanence, the Internet Archive (archive.org) or Zenodo are better choices, since those hosts allow direct archival of the actual data file.

‚úÖ Answer:

Google Drive allows files up to 5 TB (far larger than your genome FASTA), so storage space isn‚Äôt the issue ‚Äî but Drive links aren‚Äôt always permanent and don‚Äôt play well with WayBack Machine. If permanence and public archival are priorities, Internet Archive or Zenodo are better than Drive.

‚ö° Do you want me to compare Google Drive vs Internet Archive vs GitHub (chunked) specifically for your use case (public genome FASTA + WayBack Machine archival)? That might help narrow down the best option.

karbytes:

Are there file size limits for files which are uploaded to my Internet Archive library?

ChatGPT:

Internet Archive (Archive.org) is a great option for hosting and preserving large files. Here's how it handles large uploads:

üì§ File Size & Upload Limits

No strict hard limit on file size or number of files. You can upload very large files. However, for stability:

It‚Äôs recommended to keep individual files under ~50 GB

Ideally, each item (which may contain multiple files) should be under about 500 GB and fewer than ~1000 files per item.

Some users have successfully uploaded files much larger than 50 GB, but uploads over that threshold may fail or timeout.

Older accounts report an internal timeout (around 24-hour mark), which caused uploads over ~4 GB to fail; resuming or breaking into smaller files helped.

There‚Äôs also an overall recommendation to keep items under ~400‚ÄØGiB for reliability during creation and derivation (processing).

üß† Practical Guidance for Your Genome File

A 3‚Äì4 GB FASTA (possibly compressed to ~800 MB) is well within safe upload size.

You can upload it as a single file, ideally under ~50 GB, with no issues.

If you also include additional files (like metadata, README, etc.), ensure the total remains under ~500 GB and fewer than ~1000 files per item.

If you ever need to upload files above ~50 GB, consider splitting into smaller parts or using the BitTorrent upload method, which supports resumable multi-day uploads and is more robust for very large datasets.

‚úÖ Summary Table

[preformatted_text]

Item ---------------------------------------| Recommendation ----------------------------| Notes

Single FASTA (~3‚Äì4 GB) ---------------------| ‚úÖ Safe -----------------------------------| Well within limits

Compressed FASTA (~800 MB) -----------------| ‚úÖ Safe -----------------------------------| Ideal for compact storage

Large files (~>50 GB) ----------------------| ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky ----------------------------------| May timeout or fail; splitting recommended

Entire item size + all files ---------------| üëç Keep < 500 GB & < 1000 files -----------| Helps maintain stability and derivation processing

[end preformatted_text]

üß© What About Archiving with Wayback Machine?

Internet Archive fully archives uploaded files‚Äîincluding your genome FASTA‚Äîso the actual data is preserved, not just a download page (unlike Google Drive).

If always-online time is a concern, consider using the Torrent upload method: Archives fetch via BitTorrent, allowing interrupted uploads to resume and ensuring full file integrity.

üß† Final Verdict

Yes, you can comfortably upload your genome FASTA to your Internet Archive library. For best results:

Upload as a single file under ~50 GB, or compressed to under 1 GB.

Keep the total item (including other files) under ~500 GB and fewer than ~1000 files.

If future uploads might exceed these, consider torrent-based uploading or splitting.

Would you like help drafting a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep upload plan‚Äîpossibly using the torrent approach for maximum reliability and archival quality?

karbytes:

It seems that files which are hosted in my Internet Archive library cannot be saved to the WayBack Machine.

ChatGPT:

You‚Äôve noticed something important üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôre right:

Files you upload into your Internet Archive library (archive.org items) don‚Äôt get separately ‚ÄúWayback‚Äëcaptured‚Äù the way ordinary web pages do.

Here‚Äôs why, and what it means for your genome FASTA:

üîπ Why Your Internet Archive Uploads Aren‚Äôt in the Wayback Machine

The Wayback Machine is a web crawler: it snapshots publicly available web pages and the resources linked on them.

The Internet Archive library (your uploads) is a different system: when you upload to Archive.org, your files are stored in their data repository, not automatically crawled and mirrored into the Wayback Machine.

So a file in your Internet Archive library will live at a permanent archive.org URL (like https://archive.org/details/your_item_name) but won‚Äôt also show up if you try to ‚ÄúSave Page Now‚Äù the file link to the Wayback Machine.

üîπ Key Distinction

[preformatted_text]

Feature ------------------| Wayback Machine ----------------------------------------| Internet Archive Library

Source -------------------| Automated (or manual) web snapshots --------------------| Direct user uploads

Persistence --------------| Mirrors web pages, prone to robots.txt deletions -------| Long‚Äëterm repository, much more stable

File capture -------------| Often skips large/binary files -------------------------| Stores full original files you upload

Your genome FASTA --------| May fail (too large / crawler limits) ------------------| ‚úÖ Works fine, permanent item hosting

[end preformatted_text]

üîπ What This Means for You

If your main goals are:

Public access to your genome FASTA

Long‚Äëterm archival (not depending on third‚Äëparty servers staying online)

‚Üí The Internet Archive library is actually the better place than trying to force the Wayback Machine to capture a 3‚Äì4‚ÄØGB FASTA.

The Wayback Machine is ideal for HTML pages and small media. For large scientific data, Archive.org‚Äôs library service is what researchers use (think datasets, audio/video collections, etc.).

üîπ Hybrid Approach (if you want both)

Upload your genome FASTA to Internet Archive library (for permanent hosting).

Create a GitHub page or blog post describing it, with a link to the archive.org item.

Then use Wayback Machine ‚Üí Save Page Now on that GitHub/blog post page.

This way, the Wayback Machine preserves the page and the link, while the full file is stored in the Internet Archive library.

That gives you both the Wayback snapshot of the description/link and the permanent Internet Archive hosting of the genome file.

‚úÖ Bottom line: You‚Äôre correct ‚Äî your Internet Archive uploads won‚Äôt themselves be Wayback‚Äësaved, but they don‚Äôt need to be. Instead, you can Wayback‚Äësave the page that links to them, ensuring both discoverability and permanence.

‚ö° Would you like me to show you how to structure a GitHub page or blog entry so the Wayback Machine capture will nicely index and preserve the link to your genome FASTA on Archive.org?

karbytes:

I think it is best that I do the following: (a) upload my entire genome FASTA file to my Internet Archive library and provide a hyperlink to that Internet Archive file library on a special page of my website for referencing my whole genome data and (b) breaking my FASTA file into multiple smaller text files which are stored on my GitHub account and which are referenced via raw file hyperlinks on that genome web page of my blog (so that those parts files can be saved to the WayBack Machine). Also, I would link to a program which would recombine those parts files into the original FASTA file and link that program file to that genome page of my blog.

ChatGPT:

That‚Äôs an excellent plan ‚Äî it combines the permanence and stability of the Internet Archive with the Wayback‚Äëfriendly granular backup of GitHub. Let‚Äôs break down what you outlined so you can see the benefits and any adjustments you might consider.

‚úÖ Your Proposed Strategy

(a) Full Genome on Internet Archive

Upload entire FASTA to your Internet Archive library.

Link to it from a dedicated ‚ÄúMy Genome‚Äù page on your blog.

This ensures a single permanent copy, accessible for scientific use, without chunking.

Benefits:

Archive.org is well‚Äësuited to multi‚ÄëGB files.

Provides a canonical, stable file location.

Good discoverability (Archive.org content is indexed by search engines).

(b) Chunked FASTA on GitHub

Use split to break the FASTA into <100 MB text files.

Upload chunks to GitHub (normal repo, no LFS needed).

Use raw GitHub links to reference each chunk from your genome page.

Wayback Machine can crawl and preserve each chunk.

Benefits:

Each chunk is Wayback‚Äësavable (GitHub raw files are standard HTTPS).

Redundancy: if Archive.org is unavailable, chunks remain retrievable.

Works around GitHub‚Äôs 100 MB per‚Äëfile limit.

(c) Recombination Program

Provide a script that reconstructs the full FASTA from chunks.

Example script (Bash):

[bash]

#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./recombine_genome.sh output.fasta
cat genome_part_* > "$1"
echo "Recombined genome saved as $1"

[end bash]

Or a cross‚Äëplatform Python script for wider accessibility:

[python]

# recombine_genome.py
import sys
import glob

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Usage: python recombine_genome.py output.fasta")
    sys.exit(1)

with open(sys.argv[1], "wb") as out:
    for part in sorted(glob.glob("genome_part_*")):
        with open(part, "rb") as f:
            out.write(f.read())

print(f"Recombined genome saved as {sys.argv[1]}")

[end python]

Benefits:

Ensures anyone can reconstruct the full FASTA.

Preserves scientific usability.

üìå Suggested Structure for Your Genome Page

Here‚Äôs a clean outline for the special blog page:

Title: My Whole Genome (FASTA Format)

Introduction:

‚ÄúThis page hosts my entire human genome in FASTA format, made publicly available for open scientific reference. Below you will find permanent archive and Wayback‚Äësavable copies.‚Äù

Download Options:

Full FASTA (Internet Archive): [Link]

Chunked FASTA (GitHub, Wayback‚Äësavable):

Part 1 [Raw GitHub Link]

Part 2 [Raw GitHub Link]

‚Ä¶

Recombination Script: [GitHub Link to Script]

Instructions:

Download all FASTA parts.

Download the recombination script.

Run the script to reassemble the full genome.

License / Disclaimer:

(e.g. This genome is released into the public domain for educational and research use.)

üîπ Why This Hybrid Plan is Solid

Resiliency: Two different archives (Internet Archive + GitHub + Wayback).

Permanence: Archive.org ensures long‚Äëterm stability.

Redundancy: Wayback snapshots of GitHub parts protect against loss.

Usability: With a provided recombination script, your genome remains scientifically usable.

‚ö° If you‚Äôd like, I can generate a ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse HTML snippet for your genome page (with placeholders for the Archive.org and GitHub links) so you can drop it straight into your WordPress blog. Would you like me to do that?

‚úÖ Notes for Your Blog Page

Place these two scripts in your GitHub repo along with the genome chunks.

On your genome page, link to both scripts (so readers can choose whichever language works for them).

If you want, you can also provide a checksum file (like SHA256) of the recombined FASTA so readers can verify integrity.

‚ö° Would you like me to also create a checksum generator script (so users can verify the recombined genome FASTA matches your original file exactly)? That would make your archive more robust and scientifically trustworthy.

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Perfect üëç ‚Äî adding a checksum verification step is a very smart idea, especially for something as critical as your genome FASTA. It ensures that anyone who reconstructs the file from your GitHub parts can confirm it‚Äôs bit‚Äëfor‚Äëbit identical to the original.

üìå How to Use This in Your Blog Workflow

After creating your full genome FASTA (from Dante Labs), generate a checksum (checksum.txt) using one of the scripts.

Upload the checksum file to GitHub alongside your recombination scripts and chunks.

Link the checksum file from your genome blog page.

In your instructions, tell readers:

Recombine the genome FASTA from chunks.

Run checksum verification.

If verified ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù the file matches the original exactly.

‚ö° If you want, I can also add a ready‚Äëmade instructions section for your HTML genome page that shows readers how to run the checksum verification (in both Bash and Python) so they don‚Äôt have to figure it out. Would you like me to draft that too?

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Great üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a drop‚Äëin instructions section you can paste into your genome page HTML. It explains to readers how to verify the recombined FASTA file using the checksum you provide.

üìÑ HTML Snippet: Checksum Verification Section

[html]

<h2>Checksum Verification</h2>
<p>
  To ensure that the recombined FASTA file is identical to the original, verify 
  its SHA256 checksum using the provided <code>checksum.txt</code> file.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Download the Checksum File</h3>
<p>
  Download the checksum file from GitHub:<br>
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/checksum.txt" target="_blank">
    checksum.txt
  </a>
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Verify the File</h3>
<p>After recombining the FASTA file, run one of the following scripts:</p>

<h4>Option A: Bash</h4>
<pre>
chmod +x genome_checksum.sh
./genome_checksum.sh verify my_genome.fasta checksum.txt
</pre>
<p>
  If the file matches, you will see:<br>
  <code>my_genome.fasta: OK</code>
</p>

<h4>Option B: Python</h4>
<pre>
python genome_checksum.py verify my_genome.fasta checksum.txt
</pre>
<p>
  If the file matches, you will see:<br>
  <code>Checksum verified: OK</code>
</p>

<h3>Why Verify?</h3>
<p>
  Verification ensures the recombined FASTA file is <strong>bit-for-bit identical</strong>
  to the original genome FASTA hosted on the Internet Archive. This guarantees 
  data integrity for scientific use.
</p>

[end html]

üîπ Next Steps for You

Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO with the actual values.

Upload checksum.txt, genome_checksum.sh, and genome_checksum.py to GitHub.

Link them on your genome blog page (next to your recombination scripts).

Generate the checksum.txt file after you have your final FASTA from Dante Labs.

‚ö° If you‚Äôd like, I can also show you the exact Bash command you‚Äôll run on your local machine to generate the SHA256 checksum for your FASTA once you have it, so you know exactly what will go in checksum.txt. Would you like me to give you that one‚Äëliner?

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Perfect üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs the exact one‚Äëliner you‚Äôll run on your local machine to generate a SHA256 checksum for your Dante Labs FASTA file:

üîπ Generate Checksum (Bash One‚ÄëLiner)

[bash]

sha256sum my_genome.fasta > checksum.txt

[end bash]

‚úÖ What Happens

sha256sum my_genome.fasta ‚Üí computes the SHA256 hash of your genome file.

> checksum.txt ‚Üí saves the result into a file named checksum.txt.

The resulting file will look something like this:

[preformatted_text]

3c1f6c81e34a77ed5d9c15a2a1c5fbc243f17d99b2998c0f615dc8f4a6a4f5b8  my_genome.fasta

[end preformatted_text]

üîπ Verify Later

To verify after recombining:

[bash]

sha256sum -c checksum.txt

[end bash]

If the recombined FASTA matches the original exactly, you‚Äôll see:

[preformatted_text]

my_genome.fasta: OK

[end preformatted_text]

üîπ Tip for Windows Users

If some readers use Windows without WSL or Git Bash, they can use the Python script you provide instead, since Python runs on Windows natively.

‚ö° If you‚Äôd like, I can also show you how to compress your FASTA into a .gz file before checksumming ‚Äî this reduces size (important for faster downloads and fewer GitHub chunks) while still allowing verification. Want me to add that too?

karbytes:

How many <25mb sized chunk files do you think I would need to make for my entire genome FASTA?

ChatGPT:

Good question üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs estimate based on the expected size of your Dante Labs FASTA.

üîπ Step 1: Size of a Whole Genome FASTA

A human genome FASTA (just sequence, no quality scores) is typically ~3 GB uncompressed.

Compressed (.fa.gz), it can shrink to ~800 MB ‚Äì 1 GB.

Since you mentioned FASTA, we‚Äôll assume ~3 GB uncompressed.

üîπ Step 2: Splitting Into <25 MB Chunks

GitHub itself allows files up to 100 MB, but you specified <25 MB, which is a more conservative, Wayback‚Äëfriendly size.

Calculation:

3 GB ‚âà 3000 MB

3000 √∑ 25 = 120 chunks

So you‚Äôd need about 120 chunk files if you keep them under 25 MB each.

üîπ Step 3: Adjusting Strategy

If you‚Äôre comfortable with larger chunks (say, 90 MB each, still under GitHub‚Äôs 100 MB cap), you‚Äôd only need:

3000 √∑ 90 ‚âà 34 chunks

That‚Äôs far easier to manage than 120+ pieces.

But <25 MB does make each piece small enough that the Wayback Machine is more likely to capture them fully without timeout issues.

üîπ Recommendation

If Wayback Machine archival reliability is your top priority ‚Üí stick with <25 MB chunks (‚âà120 parts).

If convenience for users is more important ‚Üí go with ~90 MB chunks (‚âà34 parts).

‚ö° Would you like me to write a Bash command that will automatically split your FASTA into <25 MB parts and name them neatly (so you can drop them straight into GitHub)?

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Great üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a Bash one‚Äëliner that will split your whole genome FASTA into chunks <25 MB each, with clean filenames for easy uploading to GitHub and reassembly.

üîπ Bash Command to Split FASTA

[bash]

split -b 25M --numeric-suffixes=1 --suffix-length=3 my_genome.fasta genome_part_

[end bash]

‚úÖ Explanation

split ‚Üí the command that splits files.

-b 25M ‚Üí each chunk will be 25 MB max.

--numeric-suffixes=1 ‚Üí use numeric suffixes starting at 001.

--suffix-length=3 ‚Üí ensures suffixes are 3 digits (001, 002, 003, ‚Ä¶).

my_genome.fasta ‚Üí your input file.

genome_part_ ‚Üí prefix for the output chunks.

üìÇ Example Output

If your FASTA is ~3 GB, you‚Äôll see about 120 files:

[preformatted_text]

genome_part_001
genome_part_002
genome_part_003
...
genome_part_120

[end preformatted_text]

üîπ Recombination Later

Users will run your provided script (Bash or Python), which will automatically concatenate them back:

[bash]

cat genome_part_* > my_genome.fasta

[end bash]

üîπ Optional: Compress Before Splitting

If you want to reduce the number of chunks:

[bash]

gzip -c my_genome.fasta > my_genome.fasta.gz
split -b 25M --numeric-suffixes=1 --suffix-length=3 my_genome.fasta.gz genome_part_
Compression might shrink your FASTA from ~3 GB down to ~800 MB‚Äì1 GB.

[end bash]

That means only ~40 chunks instead of 120 at 25 MB each.

‚ö° Question for you:

Would you like me to adapt your recombination script so it automatically detects if the file is compressed (.gz) and, if so, decompresses it back into the FASTA? That way your users wouldn‚Äôt need to know whether they‚Äôre working with a compressed genome or not.

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Perfect üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs make your recombination script smart enough to handle both cases:

If you split the original uncompressed FASTA, it just stitches the pieces together.

If you split a compressed FASTA (.gz), it stitches them, then decompresses to produce the final FASTA.

I‚Äôll show you both Bash and Python versions so you can decide which to feature (or give both).

‚úÖ Your Workflow

Step 1. Generate Checksums (before upload)

When you have your genome files from Dante Labs:

[bash]

# For uncompressed FASTA
sha256sum my_genome.fasta > checksum_uncompressed.txt

# For compressed FASTA (.gz)
sha256sum my_genome.fasta.gz > checksum_compressed.txt

[end bash]

Now you‚Äôll have two checksum files:

checksum_uncompressed.txt

checksum_compressed.txt

Step 2. Upload Both

Upload both checksum files to your GitHub repo.

Link them from your genome page (with instructions for verifying either form).

Step 3. Users Verify

After recombining (and decompressing, if needed), users can check with either:

For FASTA

[bash]

sha256sum -c checksum_uncompressed.txt

[end bash]

For FASTA.gz

[bash]

sha256sum -c checksum_compressed.txt

[end bash]

Both should return an OK if the file is correct.

‚ö° If you want, I can now update the HTML snippet of your genome page so it clearly shows both the compressed and uncompressed checksum verification options (so you don‚Äôt have to write those instructions manually). Want me to do that?

üìÑ Updated HTML Snippet: Checksum Verification (Supports FASTA & FASTA.gz)

[html]

<h2>Checksum Verification</h2>
<p>
  To ensure the recombined genome file is identical to the original, verify its
  SHA256 checksum. Two checksum files are provided: one for the uncompressed
  FASTA and one for the compressed FASTA (.gz).
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Download the Checksum Files</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/checksum_uncompressed.txt" target="_blank">checksum_uncompressed.txt</a> (for FASTA)</li>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/checksum_compressed.txt" target="_blank">checksum_compressed.txt</a> (for FASTA.gz)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Verify the File</h3>
<p>After recombining the genome parts, run one of the following options:</p>

<h4>Option A: Verify Uncompressed FASTA</h4>
<p>If your recombination script produced <code>my_genome.fasta</code>:</p>
<pre>
sha256sum -c checksum_uncompressed.txt
</pre>
<p>
  Expected output:<br>
  <code>my_genome.fasta: OK</code>
</p>

<h4>Option B: Verify Compressed FASTA</h4>
<p>If your recombination script produced <code>my_genome.fasta.gz</code>:</p>
<pre>
sha256sum -c checksum_compressed.txt
</pre>
<p>
  Expected output:<br>
  <code>my_genome.fasta.gz: OK</code>
</p>

<h3>Alternative: Using the Provided Scripts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/genome_checksum.sh" target="_blank">Bash Checksum Script</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/genome_checksum.py" target="_blank">Python Checksum Script</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Example (Bash):<br>
  <code>./genome_checksum.sh verify my_genome.fasta checksum_uncompressed.txt</code>
</p>
<p>
  Example (Python):<br>
  <code>python genome_checksum.py verify my_genome.fasta.gz checksum_compressed.txt</code>
</p>

<h3>Why Verify?</h3>
<p>
  Verification ensures the recombined FASTA file is <strong>bit-for-bit identical</strong> 
  to the original genome hosted on the Internet Archive. This guarantees data 
  integrity for scientific and archival use.

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Excellent üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a concise step‚Äëby‚Äëstep checklist you can use when you receive your genome FASTA from Dante Labs. You could even print or save this as a plain‚Äëtext file for reference.

‚úÖ Whole Genome FASTA Publishing Checklist

1. Prepare the Genome File

Download FASTA file from Dante Labs

(Optional) Compress to .gz to reduce size:

[bash]

gzip -c my_genome.fasta > my_genome.fasta.gz

[end bash]

2. Generate Checksums

For uncompressed FASTA:

[bash]

sha256sum my_genome.fasta > checksum_uncompressed.txt

[end bash]

For compressed FASTA:

[bash]

sha256sum my_genome.fasta.gz > checksum_compressed.txt

[end bash]

3. Split into Chunks for GitHub

Split into <25 MB pieces for Wayback Machine reliability:

[bash]

split -b 25M --numeric-suffixes=1 --suffix-length=3 my_genome.fasta.gz genome_part_

[end bash]

Confirm the number of chunks (‚âà40 if compressed, ‚âà120 if uncompressed).

4. Upload Files

Upload full FASTA (compressed or uncompressed) to Internet Archive

Upload chunked parts (genome_part_*) to GitHub

Upload scripts:

recombine_genome.sh

recombine_genome.py

genome_checksum.sh

genome_checksum.py

Upload checksum files:

checksum_uncompressed.txt

checksum_compressed.txt

5. Update Genome Page on Blog

Insert Internet Archive link to full FASTA

Insert GitHub raw links for chunked files

Insert links to recombination scripts

Insert links to checksum files

Add instructions (recombine ‚Üí verify checksum ‚Üí final FASTA)

6. Archive Page for Permanence

Use Wayback Machine ‚ÄúSave Page Now‚Äù on your genome blog page to archive the instructions + GitHub links.

‚ö° That‚Äôs the whole roadmap ‚Äî straightforward and covers all the bases for availability, integrity, and archival longevity.

Do you want me to also make a plain‚Äëtext version of this checklist (monospace formatted) so it matches the style of your other technical notes?

karbytes:

I'll likely do that part manually when I have the FASTA handy. Thanks!

ChatGPT:

Sounds good üëç ‚Äî doing it manually when you have the FASTA in hand makes perfect sense. You‚Äôll be in full control of the formatting and style that best matches your archive.

When you‚Äôre ready, if you‚Äôd like me to review your finished genome page (before you push it live or send it through the Wayback Machine), I‚Äôd be happy to give it a quick pass for clarity and completeness.

Would you like me to keep this workflow fresh in memory so you don‚Äôt need to re‚Äëexplain it when you get your FASTA?

karbytes:

Sure!

ChatGPT:

[Updated saved memory]

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî I‚Äôll keep this whole genome FASTA publishing workflow fresh in memory for when you‚Äôre ready. That way, you won‚Äôt need to re‚Äëexplain the plan later.
